<li>Sheep were domesticated in pastures about 12,000 years ago, and as they were tamed, their appearance changed.</li>
<li>People bred the sheep that had the most wool, so domesticated sheep developed more wool and less hair.</li>
<li>Sheep will graze on leaves and grass. </li>
<li>Sheep are used for the same purposes today as they were many years ago — meat, skins, milk, and wool.</li>
<li>Sheep’s wool is shorn on a regular basis as it grows back, and is then cleaned, brushed and sent to be made into wool shirts, coats and other materials.</li>
